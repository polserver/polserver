busyloop for our scriptscheduler
The scheduler, if no script has to run, sleeps until the next
script is scheduled for wakeup.

For our testsystem that is not what we want, since almost no scripts are running the delays are quite huge.

So trick the scheduler by having this script run endless with a minimum of delay
