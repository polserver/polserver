base.dat: 64x64 location blocks

solidx1.dat: first-level solid index
divides world into 16x16 location blocks
If there are any blobs in the 16x16 block, this entry will contain the offset within the second index.

solidx2.dat: second-level blob index
zooms in to the 16x16 blob block.

solids.dat: the blob data
<Syzygy> well, we can try this, anyway.  The first divides the world into 16x16 squares. 
 that is used as the starting point into the first index. 
  (the assumption is that most of the world doesn't have statics, so it's a 
  sparsely populated index).  Anyway.  The second index (what we read using the
   first bit of information) is a 64x64 array of offsets of the statics. 
    0 means there are no statics at that x/y.  Otherwise, the offset is used 
    to get at the list of actual statics there, which will be a bunch of 
    triplets - z, height, flags.  Flags are the same as on the map.  
    Somehow we need a count, too.  how many statics at that location.
<Syzygy> Okay, hm, I odn't understand, maybe.  THe first index says 
"there are statics in that 16x16 block.  Their details are stored at offset N in the second index."

<Syzygy> The second index stores a 16x16 array, which has a count, and an offset, for each location.

MAP CELLS
=========
    each solid has a Z-coordinate, a height, and flags.
    The map stores each solid's Z coordinate.  Their Z coordinate is actually -128.
        
    Every map location's Z-coordinate is 

MAP FLAGS
=========
 0x01  FLAG_STANDABLE
        Indicates you can STAND on the thing.


STATICS
=======
statidx.dat: index to statics
    divides map into 8x8-cell blocks
    format: u32 offset
    use the next cell's offset to determine the count for a particular block
    
statics.dat: statics
    format:
        struct USTRUCT_POL_STATIC {
            u16 graphic;
            u8 xy; // x: high 4 bits y: low 4 bits (bit 7 and bit 3 are unused)
            s8 z;
            u16 hue;
        };

MAP TILES
=========
maptile.dat
    format:
