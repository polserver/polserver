when a player buys something from a merchant the core will not longer handle taking gold from the player, and moving items to the players pack.

  Default value is 15. Back in the POL095 days is was 9, so consider 9-15 as your "safe" play range.<br/>

    ignition = uorice = none, 2.0.0x and due to autocalculation major.minor.build (no patch)
            e.g. 7.0.4 for latest client 7.0.4.1
            default for both is "none"
    <explain>Clarification: for ClientEncryptionVersion, the allowable values are 'major.minor.build', '2.0.0x', 'ignition', 'uorice', and 'none'. Here, 'ignition', 'uorice', and 'none' all mean 'no encryption'.</explain>
    <explain>Due to autocalculation 'major.minor.build' means setting a listener for client 7.0.4.1 '7.0.4' (no patch)</explain>
    <explain>AssertionFailureAction options: abort: (like old behavior) aborts immediately, without saving data. continue: allows execution to continue. shutdown: attempts graceful shutdown. shutdown-nosave: attempts graceful shutdown, without saving data. If the assertion occurred during execution of a script, either 'shutdown', 'shutdown-nosave', or 'continue' will abort that script, displaying the script name and PC.</explain>
    <explain>Hint: LogLevel can be used to debug issues at startup of POL and various other places (unloadall for example). By setting this higher than 1, up to 11 (just sounds good), it will force printing of better information to help you find out problems during Loading and such. Setting it for example, above 0, core will start spitting out "Checkpoint" data during startup to say what it is about to load/process. Such as the configuration, load realms, load multis, etc etc.</explain>
    <explain>DiscardOldEvents: if set instead of discarding new event if queue is full it discards oldest event and adds the new event</explain>
    <explain>AccountDataSave: -1 : old behaviour, saves accounts.txt immediately after an account change, 0 : saves only during worldsave (if needed), >0 : saves every X seconds and during worldsave (if needed)</explain>
    <explain>UseSingleThreadLogin: if set all prelogin clients are handled inside the listener thread and not inside an extra thread this will reduce the amount of thread creates and destroys</explain>
    <explain>DisableNagle: disables Nagle's algorithm. In theory, latency should improve if DisableNagle=1.</explain>
    <explain>ShowRealmInfo: will report every once in a while the number of items, mobiles and multis per realm.</explain>
    <explain>EnforceMountObjtype: will enforce that only items with the mount objtype (as defined in extobj.cfg) can be mounted.</explain>
    <explain>AllowMultiClientsPerAccount: when true, will allow multiple characters from the same account to be logged in at the same time</explain>
    <explain>ProfileCProps: when true, will record CProp usage statistics. Helps detecting unused CProps, at the cost of some RAM and an unnoticeable performance impact. It should be enabled from startup, or the core will be unable to detect the type of some CProps.</explain>
    <explain>ShowWarningGump: will show unexpected gump warning messages on the console.</explain>
    <explain>ShowWarningItem: will show equip item and drop item warning messages on the console.</explain>

    <explain>Movemode string is 'L' for land 'S' for sea, and 'A' for air. I.e. 'LS' would be good for a water elemental.</explain>
    <explain>An 'intrinsic' weapon is used if the NPC does not have a weapon item equipped. It represents (usually), the Wrestling 'weapon' for the NPC. You can define sounds, damage, animation etc.</explain>
    <explain>Vital and Attribute names can use the aliases defined in attributes.cfg and vitals.cfg, i.e. 'STR' instead of 'Strength'. A Die-string may be used for the value of any of these.</explain>
    <explain>Privs and settings can be like 'invul losany' and any more seperated by spaces. Unless they also appear in 'Settings', the privileges are not active.</explain>
    <explain>UseAdjustments 1 means the NPC will adjust its facing while moving to try to avoid small obsticles. If 0, the NPC will not move if it cannot move forward, and the move function will return 0.</explain>
    <explain>RunSpeed is only useful from 0-250, the higher the number, the shorter delay between moves.</explain>
    <explain>SpeechColor and Font are only used if NPC::Say() is used.</explain>
    <explain>Alignment determines NPC's name color and their participation in the reputation system.</explain>
    <explain>Of course, you may define other config properties and cprops in this file that are not used by the core. npcdesc.cfg may be accessed with the normal Config file access functions (ReadConfigFile, etc). Note CProps in this file will be assigned to each NPC created with that template. This takes extra memory than if you look up properties using the config file access functions.</explain>
    <explain>If you have npcdes.cfg in a package, the NPC's template name becomes :packagename:templatename</explain>

  <explain><i>Packet ID:</i> must be a byte integer, i.e. 12 or 0xAE.</explain>
  <explain><i>Version:</i> is used to define multiple packethooks of the same packet type. This is due
to major packet changes by EA. It allows you to hook packets that have a different
packet structure based on the client version. Default is 1. Max right now is 2.</explain>
  <explain><i>Client string:</i> is used to determine the minimum required client version for a
packethook to work with. Note, all pre-login packets before 6.0.5.0 do not know
the client's version number in the core.</explain>
  <explain><i>Length:</i> MUST be exactly correct for fixed-length packets and in bytes (i.e. message 0x20 is 19 bytes), or the string 'variable' for variable-length packets (i.e. 0xAE unicode speech).</explain>
  <explain><i>ReceiveFunction:</i> is the function to intercept a packet coming from a client. SendFunction is to intercept an outgoing packet created by the core (i.e. player status update). Normally a Packet element will only define one of these two, unless the packet is bi-directional AND the core currently sends the packet.</explain>
  <explain><i>SubCommandOffset:</i> is the 0-based offset into the packet that contains the sub-command ID number, if applicable for this packet. SubCommandLength is the number of bytes to extract to determine the sub command (ex. 2 for 0xBF, 1 for 0x12).</explain>
  <explain><i>SubCommandID:</i> is the 2-byte ID to be found at the parent packet's SubCommandOffset. You need not define Receive and Send functions for the parent packet if you define subpacket entries. If a subcommand is received or being sent that is not hooked, the default behavior will occur. As normal, the parent packet entry must only be defined once.</explain>
  <explain><i>Hint:</i> Please do not try to hook Sub-Sub-Commands (like the 0xBF 0x06 Party System subsubcommands), instead use a case statement in the subcommand hook.</explain>
  <explain><i>Hint:</i> You can find examples in packethooks.txt</explain>
