= BObject

A `BObject` is a ref-counted holder of a reference counting pointer to a BObjectImp.

I'd like to describe here an example of a use case where there would be multiple references
to the same BObject, and compare with a use case where there would be multiple
BObjects that point to the same BObjectImp.

My main goal here is to explain (and convince myself, if possible)
why there are two levels of indirection.

We now have specialized instructions for this, but assignments to
array elements used to use this mechanism.

[source,escript]
----
var arr := { "a", "b", "c" };
arr[2] := "B";
print(arr)
----

Example:

Suppose we want to pass a variable by reference to a function:

[source,escript]
----
function foo(byref a)
    a := 7;
endfunction

var x := 6;
foo(x);
print(x); // expected output: 7
----
