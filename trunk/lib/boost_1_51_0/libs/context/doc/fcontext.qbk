[section:context Context]

Each instance of __fcontext__ represents a context (CPU registers and stack
space). Together with its related functions __jump_fcontext__ and
__make_fcontext__ it provides a execution control transfer mechanism similar
interface like
[@http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man2/getcontext.2.html ucontext_t].
__fcontext__ and its functions are located in __context_ns__ and the functions
are declared as extern "C". 

[warning If __fcontext__ is used in a multithreaded application, it can migrated
between threads, but must not reference __tls__.]

[note If __fls__ is used on Windows, the user is responsible for calling 
__fls_alloc__, __fls_free__.]

[important The low level API is the part to port to new platforms.]


[heading Executing a context]

A new context supposed to execute a __context_fn__ (returning void and accepting
intptr_t as argument) must be initialized by function __make_fcontext__.

            // context-function
            void f( intptr);

            // creates and manages a protected stack (with guard page)
            ctx::stack_allocator alloc;
            fc.fc_stack.base = alloc.allocate(ctx::minimum_stacksize());
            fc.fc_stack.limit =
                static_cast< char * >( fc.fc_stack.base) - ctx::minimum_stacksize();

            // context fc uses f() as context function
            make_fcontext( & fc, f);

__fcontext__ requires a pointer to the top of the stack (__fc_base__) as well
as a pointer to the lower bound of the stack (__fc_limit__).

Calling __jump_fcontext__ invokes the __context_fn__ in a newly created context
complete with registers, flags, stack and instruction pointers.  When control
should be returned to the original calling context, call __jump_fcontext__.
The current context information (registers, flags, and stack and instruction
pointers) is saved and the original context information is restored. Calling
__jump_fcontext__ again resumes execution in the second context after saving the
new state of the original context.

        namespace ctx = boost::ctx;

        ctx::fcontext_t fcm, fc1, fc2;

        void f1( intptr_t)
        {
                std::cout << "f1: entered" << std::endl;
                std::cout << "f1: call jump_fcontext( & fc1, & fc2, 0)" << std::endl;
                ctx::jump_fcontext( & fc1, & fc2, 0);
                std::cout << "f1: return" << std::endl;
                ctx::jump_fcontext( & fc1, & fcm, 0);
        }

        void f2( intptr_t)
        {
                std::cout << "f2: entered" << std::endl;
                std::cout << "f2: call jump_fcontext( & fc2, & fc1, 0)" << std::endl;
                ctx::jump_fcontext( & fc2, & fc1, 0);
                BOOST_ASSERT( false && ! "f2: never returns");
        }

        int main( int argc, char * argv[])
        {
                ctx::stack_allocator alloc1, alloc2;

                fc1.fc_stack.base = alloc1.allocate(ctx::minimum_stacksize());
                fc1.fc_stack.limit =
                    static_cast< char * >( fc1.fc_stack.base) - ctx::minimum_stacksize();
                ctx::make_fcontext( & fc1, f1);

                fc2.fc_stack.base = alloc2.allocate(ctx::minimum_stacksize());
                fc2.fc_stack.limit =
                    static_cast< char * >( fc2.fc_stack.base) - ctx::minimum_stacksize();
                ctx::make_fcontext( & fc2, f2);

                std::cout << "main: call jump_fcontext( & fcm, & fc1, 0)" << std::endl;
                ctx::jump_fcontext( & fcm, & fc1, 0);

                std::cout << "main: done" << std::endl;

                return EXIT_SUCCESS;
        }

        output:
            main: call jump_fcontext( & fcm, & fc1, 0)
            f1: entered
            f1: call jump_fcontext( & fc1, & fc2, 0)
            f2: entered
            f2: call jump_fcontext( & fc2, & fc1, 0)
            f1: return
            main: done

First call of __jump_fcontext__ enters the __context_fn__ `f1()` by starting
context fc1 (context fcm saves the registers of `main()`). For jumping between
context's fc1 and fc2 `jump_fcontext()` is called.
Because context fcm is chained to fc1, `main()` is entered (returning from
__jump_fcontext__) after context fc1 becomes complete (return from `f1()`).

[warning Calling __jump_fcontext__ to the same context from inside the same
context results in undefined behaviour.]

[note In contrast to threads, which are preemtive, __fcontext__ switches are
cooperative (programmer controls when switch will happen). The kernel is not
involved in the context switches.]


[heading Transfer of data]

The third argument passed to __jump_fcontext__, in one context, is passed as
the first argument of the __context_fn__ if the context is started for the
first time.
In all following invocations of __jump_fcontext__ the intptr_t passed to
__jump_fcontext__, in one context, is returned by __jump_fcontext__ in the
other context. 

        namespace ctx = boost::ctx;

        ctx::fcontext_t fc1, fcm;

        typedef std::pair< int, int >   pair_t;

        void f1( intptr_t param)
        {
            pair_t * p = ( pair_t *) param;

            p = ( pair_t *) ctx::jump_fcontext( & fc1, & fcm, ( intptr_t) ( p->first + p->second) );

            ctx::jump_fcontext( & fc1, & fcm, ( intptr_t) ( p->first + p->second) );
        }

        int main( int argc, char * argv[])
        {
            ctx::stack_allocator alloc;

            fc1.fc_stack.base = alloc.allocate(ctx::minimum_stacksize());
            fc1.fc_stack.limit =
                static_cast< char * >( fc1.fc_stack.base) - ctx::minimum_stacksize();
            fc1.fc_link = & fcm;
            pair_t p( std::make_pair( 2, 7) );
            ctx::make_fcontext( & fc1, f1);

            int res = ( int) ctx::jump_fcontext( & fcm, & fc1, ( intptr_t) & p);
            std::cout << p.first << " + " << p.second << " == " << res << std::endl;

            p = std::make_pair( 5, 6);
            res = ( int) ctx::jump_fcontext( & fcm, & fc1, ( intptr_t) & p);
            std::cout << p.first << " + " << p.second << " == " << res << std::endl;

            std::cout << "main: done" << std::endl;

            return EXIT_SUCCESS;
        }

        output:
            2 + 7 == 9
            5 + 6 == 11
            main: done


[heading Exceptions in __context_fn__]

If the __context_fn__ emits an exception, the application will terminate.


[heading Preserving floating point registers]

Preserving the floating point registers increases the cycle count for a context
switch (see performance tests).
The foruth argument of __jump_fcontext__ controls if fpu registers should be 
preserved by the context jump.

[important The use of the fpu controling argument of __jump_fcontext__ must
be consistent in the application. Otherwise the behaviour is undefined.]


[heading Stack unwinding]

Sometimes it is necessary to unwind the stack of an unfinished context to
destroy local stack variables so they can release allocated resources (RAII
pattern). The user is responsible for this task.
