This directory contains STLport-4.6.2 and ZLib 1.2.3 releases.

ZLib Windows & Linux Instructions:
    * Nothing, no need to compile anything here.
    
STLport Windows Instructions:
    * Go to STLport\src and copy "vc71.mak" to the file "makefile".
    * Make sure your VS2003 (Compiler version 7.1) command variables
      are loaded. Easiest way is to find the file "vcvars32.bat" in 
      you VS install directory and run that batch file from the
      command prompt before you copy the vc71.mak file.
    * Run the command "nmake clean all" from the prompt.
    * Run the command "mnake install" from the prompt.

Additional Linux Libraries required, and their install notes:

* Need to add these later. Blah.
