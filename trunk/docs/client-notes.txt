A place to put notes about client oddities.

For example, I want to know something: what clients versions have what limits on skill IDs?

What client versions support weather, seasons etc?

In theory the code knows about this stuff, but I would like a little more detail/explanation

Sending Season packet RESETS the lightlevel in client to 0. - issue resolved in 099

UO:SA client will only show you loginservers who's ID is 0x3D. - only UO:SA beta
